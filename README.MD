Totally Generic Platformer
==========================

Totally Generic Platfomer is a 2d platformer game written with a custom physics engine in native Java. In typical platformer style, you progress through the levels by killing enemies, making difficult jumps, and solving puzzles (soon). The game uses native Java Swing elements to render the graphical viewport. Enjoy your adventure as a cute little frog!
